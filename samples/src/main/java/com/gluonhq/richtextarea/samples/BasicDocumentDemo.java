/**
 * Basic sample with the RichTextArea control, showing a text with a default
 * font family, font size, and foreground color.
 * <p>
 * While all the control features are available, but there are no menus or
 * toolbars included, so user interaction is limited to shortcuts or context
 * menu.
 * <p>
 * For instance, after typing some text, select all (Ctrl/Cmd + A) or part of it
 * (with mouse or keyboard) and press Ctrl/Cmd + I for italic or Ctrl/Cmd + B for bold.
 * <p>
 * Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste options work as usual.
 * You can copy text with emoji unicode, and paste it on the editor.
 * For instance, while running this sample, copy this text:
 * <pre>
 *     {@code Hello üëãüèº}
 * </pre>
 * and paste it, you should see the waving hand emoji and some text. Also copying from
 * the control and pasting it on the control itself or on any other application will work
 * too, keeping the rich content when possible.
 * <p>
 * Right click to display a context menu with different options, like inserting a
 * 2x1 table.
 * <p>
 * To apply the rest of the control features, some UI is needed for user interaction. See
 * the {@link FullFeaturedDemo} sample for a complete and advanced showcase.

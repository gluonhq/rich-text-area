# The RichTextArea Samples

## BasicDemo

The most simple use case of the RichTextArea control.

It shows a prompt message, and user can add text.

While all the control features are available, but there are no menus or
toolbars included, so user interaction is limited to shorcuts or context
menu.

For instance, after typing some text, select all (Ctrl/Cmd + A) or part of it
(with mouse or keyboard) and press Ctrl/Cmd + I for italic or Ctrl/Cmd + B for bold.

Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste options work as usual.
You can copy text with emoji unicode, and paste it on the editor.
For instance, while running this sample, copy this text:

```
Hello üëãüèº
```

and paste it inside the RichTextArea control, you should see the waving hand emoji and some text. Also copying from
the control and pasting it on the control itself or on any other application will work
too, keeping the rich content when possible.

Right click to display a context menu with different options, like inserting a
2x1 table.

To apply the rest of the control features, some UI is needed for user interaction. See
the FullFeaturedDemo sample for a complete and advanced showcase.

### Usage

To run this sample, using Java 17+, do as follows:

```

## ActionsDemo

This sample shows how to use the RichTextArea control to render some text and interact with it in a basic way via three toggle buttons.

Run the sample and select some or all text, via mouse or keyboard, and then press the toggles to see how the decoration of the selection changes accordingly.

Note that when you move the caret over the text, the toggles update their state (enabled means bold/italic/underline active), showing at any time the current decoration at the caret.
